      I am an aspiring Web Developer Student seeking new opportunities and challenges. My desire to learn new skills is
      what challenges me to further enhance my education and expertise for varying industries. Being part of the SAIT's
      Web Developer Fast-Track program in 2020 helped me reinforce techniques and applications of languages such as
      Node.js/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by taking on independent and collaborative projects.

      My journey takes me way back earlier however. By 2010 I figured out microbiology is not what interests me anymore
      and I began losing motivation to continue. I felt helpless and desired more hands-on opportunities. I decided to
      switch things up and join SAIT and learn Automation and Instrumentation. Eventually I used the skills and
      knowledge to pursue Power Engineering as it was relatable to what I had learned and it was also a prerequisite to
      becoming a Petroleum Engineering Technologist.
